Freemacs is distributed using pkzip-compatible archive files.  You
can obtain a free pkzip-compatible de-archiver from the Info-Zip
Project, which can be found on ftp://ftp.cdrom.com

The editor and source code are usually distributed separately, for
those who may want to use Freemacs but don't care to look at its
source.

  emacsXXX.zip				program binaries and MINT
  emacXXXs.zip				original .ASM source code

Where XXX is the version of Freemacs.

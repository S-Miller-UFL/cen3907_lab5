This is a partial list of changes between versions 1.5f and 1.6 of Freemacs.
Unfortunately, I have made so many changes to the MINT code that it's
quite a large bit of effort to document them all.  These changes all
bring Freemacs into greater compatability with Gnu Emacs.

Primitives:

When a string is fetched using the default function, and that string
doesn't exist, the function dflta (if active, otherwise dfltn) is
executed with the SELF being the name of the original function, arg1
being the first argument of the original function.  Very magical, but
it lets Freemacs automatically load libraries.  Also lets you trap
non-existant strings, although Freemacs doesn't currently use that
ability.

Creating new buffers should work a little faster.

Some conditionally-defined code was added to my own experimental purposes.
Some of this code is dependent on the symbol KA9Q, which should be zero.
Other code is dependent on the symbol TIMING, which should be zero.

New internal variable: rc (rightmost column).

More "new" internal variables: wc, cc.  These are the foreground colors that
trailing whitespace and control characters (respectively) will be
shown in.  Actually they were in 1.5e, but they weren't announced in this
list of changes.

DesqView, Topview, and MS-Windows support added.

#(ex) -- if stdout and stderr are redirected to the same file, then the
file is only opened once, and both handles point to the same file.  The
file used to be opened twice, which caused some of the output to be
ignored.

The rightmost column on the screen contains a scroll bar that indicates
the position of point relative to the entire file.

Inverse video is now handled by swapping foreground and background rather
than using 15 - foreground and 7 - background.

String searching functions should be faster (#(mp) and #(fm)).

Regexps:  Backward regexps now work properly.  \| (alternation) is now
implemented.  Character classes match newline only if newline is the first
character in the class.  Otherwise it matches CR and LF.

The variable "Buffer-Modified" (#(lv,bm)) is now a bitmap.  Bit zero is
set if the buffer has been modified.  Bit one is set if the buffer is
read-only.

Several logical operators have been added: || (or), && (and), ^^ (xor).
They work exactly like the arithmetic operators.

The auto-save counter should only be decremented when actually waiting for
a character, as opposed to checking for a character.

The primitive #(rf) will now return "Read Only" if the file it loads
has the read-only attribute.

In ibm.asm, M-Escape was M-Esc, which was wrong.
Also in ibm.asm, only force video mode 3 if there is no memory at b800:0
	(and we're not in mode 7, i.e. monochrome text).  This lets you
	use VGA video modes that are above the standard graphics modes.

Tabs are displayed using the Whitespace color.  On an IBMPC, this will
cause the cursor to display the whitespace color when positioned over
a tab, and the foreground color when positioned over a space.

Made the stack 512 bytes instead of 256 bytes because of potential stack
overflow problems.

Mint code:

Registers now work.

This is a list of changes between versions 1.5d and 1.5e of Freemacs:

Primitives:

Bells have been revamped, thanks to Jonathan Vail.  He sent me some code
to do a visual bell (invert the video), and I added the hooks to make it
optional.  Now, #(bl) has two arguments -- pitch and duration.  If the
pitch is zero, then the pitch is really taken from the variable #(lv,bp).
If the pitch is -1, then the visual bell is used.  If the pitch is non-zero,
then a bell is rung.

If your foreground was intense white, your mode line used to blink.  This
has been fixed.

Mint code:

F:edit-options: all primitive variables that are really user preferences are
	now settable.
F:capitalize-word: didn't capitalize already-capitalized words properly.
Fxlat-region: didn't work right if the mark in arg1 wasn't a user mark.
Freadline.C-q: If you type C-q C-m, you get CRLF where you used to get CR.
Fquoted-char: add "Return" to the list of recognized keys.
F:find-file: Prompts for a filename like Gnu Emacs does.
Freadline: Now uses the variable F-delete-or-append to decide whether to delete
	or append new typein.
F-delete-or-append: If this variable is null, then the offered value when
	reading a line from the keyboard will be appended to by the first
	keypress.  If it is non-null, then the first keypress will delete
	the offered value.
M!keys-edit: Used to leave you at the end of the buffer, which was confusing.
Fargument-do: ESC 5 0 - should insert 50 dashes.  It didn't.  It does now.
Fargument-characters: Not needed anymore.
Frecall-buffer: New function.  Returns the most recently visited buffer
	that isn't visible.  The old algorithm didn't work properly in
	two-window mode.
F:select-buffer: Uses the new and improved #(Frecall-buffer).
Freturn-to-buffer: Uses the new and improved #(Frecall-buffer).
Fr: New function.  Really cute.  Make arg1 into a string, and substitute
	parameters arg2 for ARG1, arg3 for ARG2, etc...  Obviously this is
	a kludge that will only work to one level, but it's very handy.
Fy-or-n: Similar to #(Fyes-or-no) and will probably obsolete it eventually.
F:save-buffers-kill-emacs: New version -- the old one didn't quit on C-g
Ftrash-buffer: New version -- the old one didn't quit on C-g
Fok-to-trash-buffer: New version -- the old one didn't quit on C-g
Fabsolute-filename: now deals with drive names.
F:kill-trail-white: Didn't work.
F:one-window: Didn't work if the same buffer was in both windows.
Fbury-buffer: New function, used by Tags.
F:find-file: Changes to allow the use of bury-buffer.
Fyes-or-no: More like GNU Emacs.
Fcompleting-readline.C-i: More like GNU Emacs.
F:indent-rigidly: Used to indent one too many lines.
F:save-all-libs: This is simple tinkering.
Fsave-lib: This is where the buggie is.  We were entering the mode before we had
	finished changing everything.



This is a list of changes between versions 1.5c and 1.5d of Freemacs:

Conventions:

The library user.ed and user.edd (letter U) will now be automatically
loaded.  Additional packages such as etags.min and norman.min (Norman Ramsey's
preferences) will be loaded into the User library.

Primitives:

#(dt) and #(tm) have been replaced by #(ct), which returns the same value
    as Unix's ctime().  #(ct,filename) returns the time and date associated
    with the filename, or a null string if the file doesn't exist.
#(si,foo,bar) uses the string foo to translate the string bar.

Mint code:

Rudimentary editing of the minibuffer:
	C-a aka Home
	C-b aka Left Arrow
	C-d aka Delete
	C-e aka End
	C-f aka Right Arrow
	C-k
down-page and up-page now moves up or down as many lines as in its argument.
C-x 0 added.  It deletes the current window.
C-x 2 splits the current window and puts the *same* buffer in both windows.
M-x shell-command-to-buffer will put its output into the current
    buffer if an argument is given.
Filename completion now listens to F-completion-ignored-extensions, which
    causes some filename extensions to be ignored.
M-0 through M-9 and M-- are now handled the same as C-u, and either form
    may be intermingled.
M-x switch-to-buffer (C-x b) will create a buffer if it doesn't exist.
M-x yank-rectangle didn't pad short lines correctly.
When a single character answer is expected, case is now ignored.
If you try to save a file without a filename, you are prompted for one.
M-x find-file-other-window (C-x 4 f) added.
M-x switch-to-buffer-other-window (C-x 4 b) added.
M-x dired-other-window (C-x 4 d) added.


This is a list of changes between versions 1.5c and 1.5a of Freemacs:

Regular expressions are now supported in query-replace-regexp,
    isearch-forward-regexp, and replace-regexp.
If you try to load a directory, you get placed into dired-mode.
The most recent buffer visited is remembered.
If you compile something with M-x make, error messages can be parsed using
    M-x parse-error, M-x next-error, and M-x previous-error.
M-x kill-rectangle and M-x yank-rectangle now work.
M-w (copy-region) now works right when used after a kill.
M-x goto-line will prompt if no argument is given.
Fflash-paren (used by ')', ']', and '}') now works right when recording
    a key.
The absolute filename is now remembered, so that if you change the directory
    when shelled out to dos, your file will be saved from whence it came.
M-$ (spell-word) now gives an error if the speller isn't installed.
Mode selection is now chosen from Fext-mode-list.
C-x s (write-modified-files) no longer offers to save internally generated
    buffers.
Better mouse support:  If you double-click on a character, then the "right
    thing" gets selected with inverse-video.  If you then type printable
    characters, the selected text is first killed and the character is
    inserted.  If you type Back Space, the text is just killed.  If you
    double-click and then move the mouse without releasing the button,
    any amount of text can be selected.  Neat!
M-q (fill-paragraph) doesn't move the cursor.
Text mode now turns on Fill minor mode.
M-x buffer-menu has been implemented.
M-x dired has been implemented.
C-Pg Dn (next-buffer) has been implemented.
C-Pg Up (prev-buffer) has been implemented.
M-x kill-comment has been implemented.
C-M-f (forward-list) has been implemented.
C-M-b (backward-list) has been implemented.
C-x C-i (indent-rigidly) has been implemented.
C-x . (set-comment-column) has been implemented.
M-; (indent-for-comment) has been implemented.
M-x ASM-mode has been implemented.



This is a list of changes to emacs.exe from version 1.5a of Freemacs:

#(sv,as,xxx) -- Auto Save now only counts keystrokes.
#(sv,mb,2) makes the buffer write protected.  (Doesn't really
    work right yet).
#(an,foo,,bar) will put bar AFTER the cursor in the minibuffer.  I haven't
    written it yet, but this will allow editing of the minibuffer.
#(lv,cd) now returns the current directory in lower case.
#(ff,c:\) now returns c:\ so that dired works right.
#(lp,pattern,no good,regexp,case-fold) subsumes #(lr,...):
    pattern is the search pattern.
    no good is the value if the pattern is not a valid pattern (only for
        regular expressions).
    regexp is non-null if you want the pattern to be interpreted as a regular
        expression.  If it is null, then the pattern is interpreted literally.
    case-fold is non-null if you want upper and lower case to be considered the
        same.
#(it,0) no longer discards mouse buttons.
#(si,C,F) takes the ASCII value of the character C and indexes into the string S
    and returns the character found there.  For example, #(si,X,Fxlat-lower)
    will return the lower case version of X.  Same for #(si,X,Fxlat-upper),
    only upper case.
The key "M-Comma" used to be "M-," which was wrong.
IBM CGAs no longer snow.
The inner loop was sped up slightly.
#(sv,im,X) now works properly in two window mode.



Features new to 1.5:

Up to 256 K of MINT space.
More free memory when shelling out to DOS.
More GNU-Emacs-like.
Faster library loading (already in 1.4d).
Autoloading of libraries.
Searching of the path to find the libraries.
"normal" keyboard handler.
C-mode
Mint-mode
Options-mode
Text-mode
Better mouse support:  copy region, copy line, copy word.
And, as always, new and improved bugs :-)

Bugs fixed between 1.04c and 1.04a:

  o One global mark was being shared between all the buffers, so that a
    M-x set-mark and then M-x select-buffer and then M-x swap-point-and-mark
    would bring you back to the wrong place.  Now each buffer has its own
    mark.

  o #(Fmultiple) used to be non-recursive.  Now, however, if it is invoked
    as #(Fmultiple,...,...,SELF), then a unique list will be created for
    each invocation.

  o A few left-over C-[A-Z] key definitions were removed.

  o #(Fhit-any-key) now tells you a little bit more.

  o M-x find-file now listens to wildcards.

  o Wildcards in filenames on the command line now get expanded.

  o The old #(Fgoto-beginning-of-paragraph) used to loop forever at the
    beginning of the buffer.

  o M-x shell-command-to-buffer, and suspend-emacs now don't bother waiting
    for a key.

  o M-x select-buffer now defaults to the most recently visited buffer.

  o M-x filter-region didn't work if parameters to the filter were given.

  o #(Fflash-paren) used to quit at the first blank line.  Now it quits at
    the first double blank line.

  o You can now add a control character to the input line.

  o M-x compare-windows now halts when it gets to the end of the file.

  o You now get more help when you get started going.

  o #(Fwrite-file) has been improved:

Name:Fwrite-file
Actually write the file to the filename given in arg1.
If the file has a line containing "History:", the current line number and
column will get inserted following the colon.  If the file has a line
containing "Edit History:" OR if the variable edit-history is set to yes,
then every time you save the file, you will be asked why you are saving
the file, and a line with the time and date and the reason for saving will
be inserted after the "Edit History:" line.

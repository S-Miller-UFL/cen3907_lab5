[NOTES]

So I grabbed the sources from LZMA SDK 17.00 beta and very slightly
modified them for better simplicity (and 8.3 friendliness). I also
heavily rewrote the makefile.

I've successfully compiled it with GCC 7.20 (/current/ DJGPP 2.05)
using experimental COFF smartlinking. This release also avoids
*printf(), so it's noticeably smaller than before.

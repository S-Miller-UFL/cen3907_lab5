<h1>mKEYB - a very small keyboard driver for DOS</h1>
<p>mKEYB is a very small keyboard driver that can be used with any DOS.<br>
The
resident size is below 500-700 bytes, depending on the keyboard.</p>
<p>There are about 24 keyboard layouts compiled into the executable, yet the
executable size is only 8K.</p>
<p>mKEYB originated from an idea, how to write a very small keyboard driver by
recycling existing BIOS resources.<br>
So it requires much less RAM then most other
keyboard drivers, although it's written entirely in C.<br>
mKEYB requires a 80286 or
better machine.</p>
<p>mKEYB comes including source; you will need 
<a href="http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/21751">Borland Turbo C++ 1.0</a>&nbsp; to recompile it.</p>
<p>If you want to add a new language, or change an existing one, please see
readme.txt for instructions.<br>
We will be glad to incorporate your language
definitions into mKEYB, if you send us the changes.</p>
<p>License: mKEYB is free to use, change, distribute, learn from, or use in 
whatever way you see useful ...<br>
However if you offer mKEYB to others, it would
be cool if you place a link to this page onto your web page.</p>

mKEYB program and source (66K)</font></a></p>
<p>Another keyboard driver for DOS (XKEYB) can be found
<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/dos/keyb/xkeyb/">here</a>,
It's even programmable, and configurable without recompiling it; however it has
a somewhat larger executable size and RAM requirements.<br>

Language translation information for EDICT

Note variable information comes in several types and in a specific order that
cannot be changed (for now). Multiple white spaces are automatically compressed
to a single space unless quoted. To display a quote, it must be quoted by a
different type of quote. Finally, no spaces are placed before or after any
variable.

Your translation file should be placed in the NLS\EDICT directory. It's
filename extension should be the same as the standard DOS language code for
that language. For example, English is EDICT.EN and German is EDICT.DE.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes for more information
on language and country codes.

Use one of the existing translation files, like EDICT.EN as a starting point
for your translation. That way, no needed text is missing.

Variables:

    %_          A single space character
    %%          A single percent symbol
    %r          A CRLF

    %c          Insert the single character
    %s          Insert the text string
    %b          Insert the byte hex value
    %w          Insert the word hex value (unused)
    %i          Insert the integer
    %I          Insert the (integer + 1)


TITLE is the program title.

LANGUAGE is not in the default translation and should probably be in the
lanugage of the translation. You can provide something like one of these:

LANGUAGE=English Language Translation by Jerome Shidel
LANGUAGE=Deutsche ”bersetzung durch Robert Riebisch

HELP_* is the text for the help screen. Each entry is displayed on its own line.
The first time it finds a missing item, help text output stops. Up to 0xff (255)
is supported.

INVALID is used when an unrecognized command line switch is provided.

BAD_INT is used when an error occurs parsing a number from the command line.
BAD_VAL is used when a number is out of range.

BErr_* are BIOS error messages.
DErr_* are DOS error messages.

With a little modification, the BIOS and DOS error message texts in the default
external English version are a slimmed down version of those available online
from a great DOS and ASM resource at:

    http://stanislavs.org/helppc/idx_interrupt.html

Although, I may change them out for less droll customized error messages.

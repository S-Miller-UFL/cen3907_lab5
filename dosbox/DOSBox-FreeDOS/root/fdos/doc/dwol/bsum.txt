                       Copyright (C) 2017 Mateusz Viste

bsum is a tiny tool (256 bytes!) that computes the BSD checksum of any file.
It requires only a few kilobytes of memory, and is fast even on an 8086-class
PC. bsum supports files of any size (as long as your file system is able to
handle them). The BSD checksum is displayed in hexadecimal format (ie. four
alphanumeric characters, like "C2E1"). bsum is an excellent candidate for
veryfing data integrity on systems that are very constrained in terms of disk
space, memory or CPU power. Typically, bsum can be used to verify that files
transferred by unreliable means arrived intact.

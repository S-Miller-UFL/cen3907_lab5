This is a low-fat calendar program.  CAL won't display pretty colors or
remind you of appointments.  What it will do is generate simple calendars
for any month or year from 1753 through 2399, accurately and with a decent
minimum of code.  Output may be redirected.  Only Gregorian (New Style) is
supported; this is not a port of the Unix cal.

CAL       With no arguments, displays a calendar for the current month.
          Today's date will be marked with an asterisk.

CAL m/y   Generate a calendar for a specific month.  m is the month,
          1 to 12.  y is the year, 1753 to 2399.  If it's less than 100,
          2000 will be added.

CAL y     Generate a calendar for an entire year.  If output is not
          redirected, CAL will pause after June.

CAL may be distributed freely, with or without source.

       _P_i_c_o is a simple, display-oriented text  editor  based  on
       the  Pine message system composer.  As with Pine, commands
       are displayed at the bottom of the  screen,  and  context-
       sensitive  help is provided.  As characters are typed they
       are immediately inserted into the text.

       Editing commands are entered  using  control-key  combina-
       tions.   As a work-around for communications programs that
       swallow certain control characters, you can emulate a con-
       trol key by pressing ESCAPE twice, followed by the desired
       control character, e.g. "ESC ESC c" would be equivalent to
       entering  a  ctrl-c.   The editor has five basic features:
       paragraph justification,  searching,  block  cut/paste,  a
       spelling checker, and a file browser.

       Paragraph  justification  (or  filling) takes place in the
       paragraph that contains the cursor, or, if the  cursor  is
       between  lines, in the paragraph immediately below.  Para-
       graphs are delimited by blank lines, or by lines beginning
       with  a space or tab.  Unjustification can be done immedi-
       ately after justification using the control-U key combina-
       tion.

       String  searches  are  not  sensitive  to  case.  A search
       begins at the current cursor position and wraps around the
       end of the text.  The most recent search string is offered
       as the default in subsequent searches.

       Blocks of text can be moved, copied or deleted  with  cre-
       ative  use of the command for mark (ctrl-^), delete (ctrl-
       k) and undelete (ctrl-u).  The delete command will  remove
       text  between  the "mark" and the current cursor position,
       and place it in the "cut" buffer.   The  undelete  command
       effects a "paste" at the current cursor position.

       The spell checker examines all words in the text.  It then
       offers, in turn, each misspelled word for correction while
       highlighting  it  in the text.  Spell checking can be can-
       celled at any time.  Alternatively, _p_i_c_o  will  substitute
       for  the  default spell checking routine a routine defined
       by the SPELL environment variable.  The  replacement  rou-
       tine should read standard input and write standard output.

       The file browser is offered as  an  option  in  the  "Read
       File"  and "Write Out" command prompts.  It is intended to
       help  in  searching  for  specific  files  and  navigating

       directory  hierarchies.  Filenames with sizes and names of
       directories in the current working directory are presented
       for selection.  The current working directory is displayed
       on the top line of the display while the list of available
       commands  takes  up  the  bottom  two.  Several basic file
       manipulation  functions  are  supported:   file  renaming,
       copying, and deletion.

       More specific help is available in _p_i_c_o's online help.

OOppttiioonnss
       ++_n     Causes _p_i_c_o to be started with the cursor located _n
              lines into the file. (Note: no  space  between  "+"
              sign and number)

       --dd     Rebind the "delete" key so the character the cursor
              is on is rubbed out rather than  the  character  to
              its left.

       --ee     Enable file name completion.

       --ff     Use  function  keys for commands.  This option sup-
              ported only in conjunction with  UW  Enhanced  NCSA
              telnet.

       --jj     Enable  "Goto"  command  in the file browser.  This
              enables the command to  permit  explicitly  telling
              _p_i_l_o_t which directory to visit.

       --gg     Enable  "Show  Cursor" mode in file browser.  Cause
              cursor to be positioned before the  current  selec-
              tion  rather  than  placed at the lower left of the
              display.

       --kk     Causes "Cut Text" command to remove characters from
              the  cursor  position to the end of the line rather
              than remove the entire line.

       --mm     Enable mouse functionality.  This only  works  when
              _p_i_c_o  is run from within an X Window System "xterm"
              window.

       --nn_n    The -n_n option enables new mail notification.   The
              _n argument is optional, and specifies how often, in
              seconds, your mailbox is checked for new mail.  For
              example,  -n60  causes  _p_i_c_o  to check for new mail
              once every minute.  The  default  interval  is  180
              seconds, while the minimum allowed is 30. (Note: no
              space between "n" and the number)

       --oo _d_i_r Sets operating directory.  Only files  within  this
              directory   are  accessible.   Likewise,  the  file
              browser is limited to the specified directory  sub-
              tree.

       --rr_n    Sets  column  used to limit the "Justify" command's
              right margin

       --tt     Enable "tool" mode.  Intended for when _p_i_c_o is used
              as  the  editor  within  other  tools  (e.g.,  Elm,
              Pnews).  _P_i_c_o will not prompt for save on exit, and
              will  not  rename the buffer during the "Write Out"
              command.

       --vv     View the file only, disallowing any editing.

       --ww     Disable word  wrap  (thus  allow  editing  of  long
              lines).

       --xx     Disable keymenu at the bottom of the screen.

       --zz     Enable ^Z suspension of _p_i_c_o.

       Lastly,   when  a  running  _p_i_c_o  is  disconnected  (i.e.,
       receives a SIGHUP), _p_i_c_o will save  the  current  work  if
       needed  before  exiting.   Work is saved under the current
       filename with ".save" appended.  If the  current  work  is
       unnamed, it is saved under the filename "pico.save".


BBuuggss
       The  manner  in  which lines longer than the display width
       are dealt is not immediately obvious.  Lines that continue
       beyond  the  edge  of  the  display are indicated by a '$'
       character at the end of the line.  Long lines are scrolled
       horizontally as the cursor moves through them.

       pico.save        Unnamed interrupted work saved here.
       *.save           Interrupted work on a named file is saved here.

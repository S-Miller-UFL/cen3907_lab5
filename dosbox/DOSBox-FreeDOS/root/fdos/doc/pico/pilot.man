       _P_i_l_o_t is a simple, display-oriented  file  system  browser
       based  on the Pine message system composer.  As with Pine,
       commands are displayed at the bottom of  the  screen,  and
       context-sensitive help is provided.

       _P_i_l_o_t displays the current working directory at the top of
       the screen.  The directory's  contents  are  displayed  in
       columns  of  file  name,  file size pairs.  Names that are
       directories are indicated by the name "(dir)" in place  of
       the  file  size.  The parent of the current working direc-
       tory is indicated by the file name ".." and size of "(par-
       ent  dir)".   File  names that are symbolic links to other
       files are displayed with a file size of "--".

       Several basic file  manipulation  commands  are  provided:
       Delete,  Rename, Copy, View, Launch, and Edit.  The "View"
       and "Edit"  commands  operate  on  text  files  only.   By
       default,  the  "View"  command  displays files using "pine
       -F", but will respect the environment  variable  PAGER  if
       set.   The  "Edit"  command  simply  invokes  "pico".  The
       "Launch" command provides a convenient way to either  exe-
       cute the selected file or to run an application on it.

       More specific help is available in _p_i_l_o_t's online help.

       --aa     Display  all files including those beginning with a
              period (.).

       --ff     Use function keys for commands.  This  option  sup-
              ported  only  in  conjunction with UW Enhanced NCSA
              telnet.

       --gg     Enable "Show Cursor"  mode.   Cause  cursor  to  be
              positioned before the current selection rather than
              placed at the lower left of the display.

       --jj     Enable "Goto" command.  This enables the command to
              permit  explicitly telling _p_i_l_o_t which directory to
              visit.

       --mm     Enable mouse functionality.  This only  works  when
              _p_i_l_o_t is run from within an X Window System "xterm"
              window.

       --nn_n    The -n_n option enables new mail notification.   The

              _n argument is optional, and specifies how often, in
              seconds, your mailbox is checked for new mail.  For
              example,  -n60  causes  _p_i_l_o_t to check for new mail
              once every minute.  The  default  interval  is  180
              seconds, while the minimum allowed is 30. (Note: no
              space between "n" and the number)

       --oo _d_i_r Sets operating directory.  Only  files  within  the
              specified  directory are accessible and browsing is
              limited to the specified directory subtree.

       --vv     Enable single vertical column display.

       --xx     Disable keymenu at the bottom of the screen.

       --zz     Enable ^Z suspension of _p_i_l_o_t.

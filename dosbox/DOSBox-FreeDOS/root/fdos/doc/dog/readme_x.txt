How to install?

You can use (but it's not manditory) to use DOG as your primary shell. Here
is how: 
comment any lines beginning with SHELL from by adding REM and a spce infront
of the line. Then add tis line:

SHELL=C:\DOG\BIN\DOG.COM -P512

Note that the drive and path may varry according to where you put DOG.
This line will start DOG as the primary shell next time when DOS restarts.

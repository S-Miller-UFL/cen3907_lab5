version 0.9 (August 26 2011)

* Welcome to the first public release of the Senet game! It's not
  interactive (yet) but it does play a good game of Senet by
  itself. One side plays a defensive game, the other plays an
  agressive game. Released under the GNU GPL version 2.

version 1.0

* Complete re-write of Simple Senet, this time for FreeDOS. This lets
  two players play a complete game of Senet. The game rules have been
  updated/simplified from version 0.9.

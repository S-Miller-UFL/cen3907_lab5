    /C          When the /x switch is used, allows continuing despite a
                subprocess error.
    /X [cmdln]  Execute item with command line and all subsequent switches
                are passed to the subprocess. * is expanded to item, # is
                number of items and @ is index of item. If no command line
                data follows the /x switch, * is assumed.

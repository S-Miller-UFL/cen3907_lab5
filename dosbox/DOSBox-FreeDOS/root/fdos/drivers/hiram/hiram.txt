HiRAM was thoroughly tested for reliability and should function under the
specified operating conditions without problems.
All responsabilities however, fall on the user for any damages that may or may
not have been caused directly or indirectly by HiRAM.

WARNING:
HiRAM.EXE may NOT be compressed with programs such as DIET, LZEXE or PKLITE,
because it is both an executable and a DEVICE driver!

Create a bootable DOS diskette before using HIRAM.EXE!
In any case you should be familiar with the:
- CONFIG.SYS "?" instruction.
- F5/F8 keys to skip CONFIG.SYS on bootup.

INTRO:

The range between the segments A000h and F000h is designed for ISA/PCI/AGP
extension/add-on cards since the release of version 5.0 of DR-DOS and MS-DOS,
which allows UMA (Upper Memory Area) to be used.
This way the free conventional DOS memory can be increased up to ~ 620 KB.
HiRAM supports UMA on PCs with 8086/88 or 80286 processors and memory between
the segments A000h and E000h (inclusively). On PCs with 386/486 and Shadow RAM
within the above mentioned area, HiRAM can also be used, even without EMM386
and its V86 (Virtual) Mode UMBs.
Device drivers can be loaded high with DEVICEHIGH/INSTALLHIGH in CONFIG.SYS or
LOADHIGH in AUTOEXEC.BAT.

The table below shows the output of MEM (DR-DOS 6.0) on a AT/286 with 640 KB
RAM and 64 KB auxiliary RAM in the segment E000h after using HiRAM.EXE:

Memory type	(KBytes)	Available
----------------------------------------------
Conventional	655.360 (640K)	643.040 (627K)
Upper memory	65.488 (63K)	288 (0K)

Since the use of the UMA differs clearly with the DOS versions, HiRAM adjusts
automatically to the used version. Optional parameters should be used only for
special configurations or in the case of errors.

HiRAM was successfully tested under MS-DOS 3.21, 3.30, 4.01, 5.0 and 6.0, as
well as DR-DOS 3.41 and 6.0.

It is assumed HiRAM is installed in the C:\HIRAM directory.

USAGE:

Usage may differ depending on used DOS versions and/or particular hardware
requirements:

- MS-DOS starting from version 5, 8086/88 or 80286 without Extended MEMORY,
but with auxiliary memory.

CONFIG.SYS			AUTOEXEC.BAT
--------------------------------------------------------
DOS=UMB				C:\HIRAM\HiFILES=12
DEVICE=C:\HIRAM\HiRAM.EXE	LH KEYB GR,,KEYBOARD.SYS
FILES=8				...
DEVICEHIGH=...

- MS-DOS starting from version 5, 80286 with Extended MEMORY, 80386/486 with
Shadow RAM.

DEVICE drivers and TSR programs load into the UMA, but the OS kernel does not.

CONFIG.SYS			AUTOEXEC.BAT
--------------------------------------------------------
DOS=HIGH,UMB			C:\HIRAM\HiFILES=12
DEVICE=C:\HIRAM\HiRAM.EXE	LH KEYB GR,,KEYBOARD.SYS
FILES=8				...
DEVICEHIGH=HIMEM.SYS
...

DEVICE drivers and TSR programs load into the UMA, but the OS kernel does not.

- DR-DOS starting from version 5, 8086/88 or 80286 without Extended MEMORY,
but with auxiliary memory.

CONFIG.SYS			AUTOEXEC.BAT
---------------------------------------------------------
HIDOS=ON			MEMMAX +U
SHELL=COMMAND.COM /P /MU	C:\HIRAM\HiFILES=15
DEVICE=C:\HIRAM\HiRAM.EXE	KEYB GR,,KEYBOARD.SYS /MU
FILES=5				HILOAD ...
HIBUFFERS=...
HIDEVICE=...

DEVICE drivers, TSR programs and the OS kernel load into the UMA.

- DR-DOS starting from version 5, 80286 with Extended MEMORY, 80386/486 with
Shadow RAM.

CONFIG.SYS			AUTOEXEC.BAT
---------------------------------------------------------
HIDOS=ON			MEMMAX +U
SHELL=COMMAND.COM /P /MH	C:\HIRAM\HiFILES=15
DEVICE=HIDOS.SYS /BDOS=FFFF	KEYB GR,,KEYBOARD.SYS /MH
DEVICE=C:\HIRAM\HiRAM.EXE	HILOAD ...
FILES=5
HIBUFFERS=...
HIDEVICE=...

DEVICE drivers and TSR programs load into the UMA, but the OS kernel is
shifted into the HMA.

HiRAM tests the upper memory in 4 KB steps for the presence of upper RAM and
initializes it if necessary.

HiRAM does not occupy additional memory after successful initialization if
using DR-DOS 3.41 and MS-DOS. If using DR-DOS 5.0 or 6.0 only 48 Bytes load in
the UMA.

Optional Parameters:

In special cases HiRAM behavior can be controlled by specific command line
parameters.
Syntax:

DEVICE=[Lw:][\Pfad\]HiRAM.EXE [/option [/option [...]]]

Debug tests the upper memory and outputs the determined allocation at the
display, however initialization and installation are prevented.

	/Exclude=area
	/X=area
	/E=area
DEVICE=HiRAM.EXE /X=-D100, e800-e9ff, eb00, ed00
exclude the range from A000h-D1FFh, E800h-E9FFh, EB00h-EBFFh and ED00h-EFFFh.

	/FixMSDOS
initialize the memory expansion according to type of MS-DOS 5.0/6.0.

	/FixDRDOS
initialize the memory expansion according to type of DR-DOS 5.0/6.0.

	/Chain
causes the connection of conventional memory and UMBs.

	/NoChain
prevents the connection of conventional memory and UMBs.

	/Int2F
causes the installation of INTERRUPT Handlers, which broadcast the available
upper memory to the operating system. The Handler for MS-DOS 5.0/6.0 is only
temporary, i.e., it reports according to the request of upper memory
independently from the memory. Therefore this option should be used with
extreme caution, in order to avoid system crashes.

	/NoInt2F
prevents the standard installation messages of INTERRUPT Handlers.

Internal defaults used for:

- MS-DOS 5:
	/FixMSDOS /NoChain /Int2F

- MS-DOS 4 + DR-DOS 3.41:
	/FixMSDOS /Chain /NoInt2F

- DR-DOS 5:
	/FixDRDOS /Chain /Int2F

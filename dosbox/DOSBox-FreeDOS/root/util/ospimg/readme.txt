The OSPlus Disk Imager is a utility that lets you read floppy disks and
create images of them on your hard disk. These can then be written to a CD,
zipped and e-mailed or uploaded to the Internet. The Disk Imager also lets you
write these images back to a floppy disk. Be warned that any existing data on
the floppy will be DESTROYED when writing an image.

The image you write doesn't have to have been created with the Disk Imager.
There are no identifing "marks" in the image file that say it's been created
with the Disk Imager - it's just the exact contents of the floppy disk. This
can be written back to disk with other tools such as RAWRITE (which Disk
Imager is based on). Please note that some imaging tools such as "DIM" have
their own headers - these disks may not work properly when written.

USING THE DISK IMAGER
=====================

In case you can't figure out how to use the program, here's a brief guide.

To create an image from a disk

To create an image file from a disk, do the following:

1. Start Disk Imager, either by typing DSKIMAGE or double-clicking the icon
   if using Windows or another GUI.

2. Choose Read Image from Disk from the File menu, or press F2. A dialog will
   appear.

3. Type the name of the file you want created (plus the path), or click the
   Browse dialog and do it that way.

4. Click OK to read the disk and create a disk image.

To write an image back to a disk
================================

To write an image file to a disk, do the following:

1. Start the Disk Imager, as above.

2. Choose Write Image to Disk from the File menu, or press F3. A dialog will
   appear.

3. Type the full path to the file you want to write to the disk, or click the
   Browse dialog to find it graphically.

4. Click OK to write the disk image to the disk.

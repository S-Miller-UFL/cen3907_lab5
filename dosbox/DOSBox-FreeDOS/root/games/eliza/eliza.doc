If you've been around the computer business long enough you've heard 
about Eliza, an early limited attempt at AI (or was that AS - Artificial 
Stupidity). This version is a translated from an old CPM Basic version of 
the program. This came about as the result of a discussion about AI on CIS.
Eliza can either cure your psychosis or generate new ones depending on how 
you take it. 

The orginal Basic program that this version of Eliza was derived from is
included as ELIZA.BAS. The new Turbo Pascal program is provided as 
ELIZA.PAS. The file RESPONSE.DAT contains the various responses that
Eliza will generate to the questions asked.

Enjoy!

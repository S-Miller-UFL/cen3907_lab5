Bolitaire 0.62a 12th Mar 2005
----------------------------


Who and why created Bolitaire ?
    Bolitaire was created by Yzone software. It was created because
its author wants to develope some high quality software.


What is Yzone software ?
    Yzone software is the name under which I publish my software.


What is Bolitaire ?
    Bolitaire is a free freecell clone for dos,windows and linux. The look and
feel of the game is much similar to MS freecell game. It just got better with a 
addition of mp3 player and background selection,


Where is its sourcecode ?
    Right now the source code* is pretty awkword. But any way I will release the 
source code so someone can learn from my mistakes. The source code will be released 
after three months release of the bolitaire version 1.
 

* I am learning while programming this software, so the source code is awkword and the
most of the original code of the program is poor. Anyway program works, works well.

This is the MSDOS port of Gnuchess 4.0 patchlevel 60.  It was compiled
using the Microsoft C/C++ 7.0 optimizing compiler.

No source codes are contained in this distribution; they can be obtain
from the standard places (prep.ai.mit.edu).  Only the executables, the
language file, the readable book and the binary book are included.

I have used the following switches during the compilation.
-DAG4 -DQUIETBACKGROUND -DNOSCORESPACE -DHISTORY -DGDX -DSEMIQUIETBOOKGEN
-DNULLMOVE

The static cache (-DCACHE) has been omitted as it requires LOTS of memory
which is not available in DOS.

I have also taken the liberty of correcting a few bugs that I have found
(and reported to the development team).  I have enhanced the gnuan program
to ignore moves that can be found in the book.

On a 386-25 machine, gnuchess 4.0 clocked around 600-800 nodes/sec though
it will probably clock more for the endgame.  (Pretty slow I thought).

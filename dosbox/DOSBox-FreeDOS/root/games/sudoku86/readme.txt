*** INTRO ***

Sudoku86 is a Sudoku game designed to run under DOS. It is a 16-bit, real
mode application using CGA or VGA video output (320x200). It has been
compiled using Turbo C 2.0.1. Sudoku86 comes with 100 embedded sudoku grids
of variable difficulty, and allows to load external level files, too.

Sudoku86 requires:
 - 50K of free conventional memory
 - an 8086/8088 compatible CPU
 - a CGA, MCGA or VGA graphic card
 - a two-button mouse
 - a DOS 3.0+ compatible operating system


*** USAGE ***

Mouse left click:
 Selects a number when clicked on the left selection panel, and fills a field
 with the selected number when clicked on a playable field.

Mouse right click:
 If clicked on an empty playable field, it will write a 'note' on the field
 with the currently selected digit. If the field already contains this note,
 then the field will get cleared. When clicked on a filled field, right click
 will clear the field, and restore notes that were previously set (if any).

Keyboard:
 1-9   Selects a digit on the left panel
 SPACE Selects the next digit on left panel
 C     Clears the play field
 N     Loads a new level
 F1    Help screen
 F5    Save your game
 F7    Load your game
 ESC   Quits the game


*** CUSTOM LEVELS ***

If you'd like to play your own, custom levels with Sudoku86, then you can use
the included SDM2LEV tool to convert a *.sdm collection of levels into
Sudoku86 native 'LEV' format.

 Example: SDM2LEV levels.sdm levels.lev

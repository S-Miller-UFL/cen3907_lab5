               Introducing the MVP Distribution Network

Have you heard about the MVP Distribution Network?  MVP Software is
joining forces with BBS sysops in a joint effort that will help both
of us.  I'd like to invite you to become a member of the MVPDN.
Here's how it can benefit you.

Near and dear to all sysops' hearts are callers.  If you run a
subscription BBS, then more callers means more money.  If you run a
free BBS, then more callers means that more people are finding what
they want on your system.  Participating in the MVPDN will increase
the traffic on your board.

Participating sysops in the MVPDN receive all of our popular games
and entertainment-related shareware directly from MVP Software,
before it is available on other boards or from shareware disk
vendors.

What about the quality of our games?  Good question.  AOL has chosen
many MVP games as Top Picks over the years.  PsL News chose both
Robomaze II and Robomaze III as the top new arcade games of 1991,
tied with several Apogee games.  Corncob 3D, our award-winning
flight sim, was nominated in two categories by the Shareware
Industry Awards, received an Editor's Choice in Shareware Magazine,
and has been favorably reviewed in PC/Games, Nuts and Volts, In
Flight, Computer Gaming World, and several other publications.  In
1994 MVP Bridge (DOS) was chosen by CGW as best shareware card game
of the year and was nominated by PC Magazine as one of the five best
shareware games of the year, all categories, and Pickle Wars was
nominated by CGW as one of the three best arcade/adventure shareware
games of the year.  In 1995 MVP Bridge for Windows was nominated by
CGW as one of three best shareware card and casino games, and MVP
Wordsearch for Windows was nominated by the SIA as one of the best
in its category.

And the best is yet to come.  We have released our first Windows95
game, and we have lots of exciting new games under development.

Don't miss out!  Be the first BBS in your area to carry these hot
new shareware products!  These are just some of the reasons to join
the MVPDN now and grow with us.  It's easy to join the MVP
Distribution Network.  Here's what you do.

1. Not all boards qualify to be a distribution site for MVP
   Software.  We would love to have them all, but since we mail all
   new releases and updates directly to each sysop, the cost is
   prohibitive.  So to qualify, your board MUST be online 24 hours a
   day.  I'm sorry, but we can't support part-time boards.

2. Call MVP's home BBS, Ryan's Bar, at 616-456-1845 or
   616-456-5342.  If you have difficulty getting through to Ryan's
   Bar, download the MVP files from Exec-PC, the world's largest
   BBS, by calling (414) 789-4360.  Look for the free MVP file
   section on either board.  Download all the files in the MVP file
   section.  Call Dave Snyder at (616) 245-8376 (voice) so we can
   add your name and address to our database.

3. Create a file section on your system called MVP SOFTWARE.  This
   file section will contain all MVP shareware products.

4. Post the MVP bulletin and the MVP log-on message on your board
   to let your users know you are a distribution site.  These are
   found in the SYSOPMVP.ZIP file.

5. We will notify yo of new releases and updates.  You will also
   receive our periodic sysop newsleter, MVPDN News.

And that's all there is to it!  I hope you will join us today.

Catalog vendors: Please include MVP Paint in your printed and disk
                 shareware catalogs.  For best sales results use one
                 of the above descriptions.  In addition, all MVP
                 product listings MUST include the words "by MVP
                 Software" or "an MVP Software production." This
                 encourages repeat sales, which is good for both of
                 us.  The only exception to this is if the catalog
                 has a separate MVP Software section.  No vendor may
                 charge a fee of more than $8.00 for the shareware
                 version of this product.  Vendors are encouraged to
                 contact MVP Software directly to get the latest
                 version of the product and to be added to our
                 mailing list for direct mailings of updates &

This is the macro I use within the editor to run CallTPC7:

(defmacro 'Pascal Compile current file [Ctrl+F9]'
 (eval
  (RunProgram (+ "d:/calltpc7.exe " (strxlt (WhichEditor 0) "/" "\\") ) 1 )
 )
)

The macro changes the slashes in the filename of the source file to backslashes.
Otherwise, the Pascal compiler won't compile the file.

       sseetteeddiitt  is  a  friendly console text editor with the look
       and feel of the Borland editors for  DOS.  This  man  page
       only describes the command line options of the editor. You
       can get full help about the editor using the help  of  the
       editor.

       Any  number  of  file  names  can  be  specified after the
       options and they will be automatically loaded by the  edi-
       tor in the same order you listed them.

       You can pass extra command line options using the SET_CMD-
       LINE environment variable. Read the documentation for more
       information about this feature.

       +[line number]
              Makes  the  editor jump to the specified line. This
              option only affects the next file in the  list.  It
              should be used after any option starting with minus
              and before the file name you want  affect.  If  the
              line  number is omitted the editor jumps to the end
              of the text. Example: +6 p.txt it  loads  the  file
              called p.txt and jumps to the line number 6. That's
              very similar to the VI behavior.

       -b, --bios-keyb
              [[OOnnllyy ffoorr DDOOSS]] Use the BIOS routines  for  keyboard
              handling.  They  are  slow  but  reliable.   That's
              enabled by default.

       -B, --no-bios-keyb
              [[OOnnllyy ffoorr DDOOSS]] Don't use the BIOS routines for key-
              board handling. They are faster but in some partic-
              ular machines fails you can just experiment.

       -c, --cascade
              After  opening  all  the  files  the  windows   are
              arranged  using cascade style.  Only editor windows
              are affected.

       -d, --stack-dbg=n
              It indicates which methode  will  be  used  in  the
              event of an editor crash.  The default methode is 0
              but you can  override  it  using  the  SET_STACKDBG
              environment  variable.  The available methodes are:
              0: dump unsaved buffers and  stack  calls.   1:  do
              nothings  (conservative).  You should use it if the

              editor is experimenting very  catastrphic  crashes.
              2:  [[OOnnllyy  ffoorr LLiinnuuxx]] dump unsaved buffers and call
              debugger to get information. Finally die.  3: [[OOnnllyy
              ffoorr  LLiinnuuxx]] like 2 but stay in the debugger.  The 0
              option disables the hook of  signals  to  save  the
              modified buffers during a crash. Could be needed if
              the editor hangs in an extraordinary  way.  Usually
              the editor dumps to ssttddeerrrr all the files you didn't
              save, as the ssttddeerrrr is redirected by the editor  to
              a temporal file you can recover unsaved data.  This
              temporal file is stored in your home directory  for
              Linux and in _%_D_J_D_I_R_%_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_s_e_t_e_d_i_t for DOS.  To use
              the options 2 and 3 you must  have  a  binary  with
              debug  information  and  also  the nnmm and ggddbb tools
              installed in your system. If you use the option  3,
              the  editor  is running in X and xxtteerrmm is installed
              then the debugger will be started  in  a  separated
              window.

       -f, --file-list file_name
              Loads  the  files listed in the specified file. The
              file must contain one name by line. You can specify
              more than one list.

       -h, --help
              Displays the command line options of the editor.

       -k, --use-rh-52-keys
              [[OOnnllyy ffoorr LLiinnuuxx]] Enables the Red Hat 5.2 style key-
              board mapping. That's needed if you are experiment-
              ing  some strange function keys behavior. Some key-
              board mapping files redefines the function key num-
              bers in a good way but really incompatible with the
              old way. I first found it in Red Hat 5.2.

       -K, --keybind file_name
              Uses the specified name  as  keybinding  file.  The
              file  should be full qualified, the editor will use
              this name for reading and writing keyboard configu-
              ration.

       -l, --force-no-lfn
              [[OOnnllyy  ffoorr  DDOOSS]]  Avoids the use of long file names
              under W9x. Even if  the  LLFFNN  environment  variable
              says the reverse.

       -L, --force-lfn
              [[OOnnllyy  ffoorr  DDOOSS]]  Forces the use of long file names
              under W9x. Even if  the  LLFFNN  environment  variable
              says the reverse.

       -m, --no-mouse-hook
              [[OOnnllyy ffoorr DDOOSS]] Don't hook the mouse interrupt. Cur-

              ous problems with the mouse.

       -M, --no-mixer
              If the editor was compiled with board  level  sound
              mixer  support  this  option completly disables it.
              That's here to prevent any interference with  other
              programs  using the mixer or potential missbehavior
              due to the use of I/O ports  during  the  detection
              process under DOS.

       -p, --project file_name
              Loads  the  indicated  project, if the file doesn't
              exist the editor creates a new one.

       -r, --no-redirect
              Disables the stderr redirection. Only  used  during
              debugging  process, if you don't do it while debug-
              ging you won't be able to collect debugging  infor-
              mation sent to the ssttddeerrrr output.

       -t, --tile-vert
              After   opening  all  the  files  the  windows  are
              arranged using vertical  tile  style.  Only  editor
              windows are affected.

       -T, --tile-horiz
              After   opening  all  the  files  the  windows  are
              arranged using horizontal tile style.  Only  editor
              windows are affected.
